Just choose one of the possibilites we have thought in our [Contribution Program](https://github.com/bitDubai/contribution-program/blob/master/README.md) or contact us to propose your own [here](https://bitdubai.com/wp/#GETINVOLVED)

If you have a Developer Team (or can easily gather one) you will probably like to get an assigned task in our development program to get the corresponding bounty. Please visit our [Bounty Program](https://github.com/bitDubai/bounty-program/blob/master/README.md). 

If you are interested in a rewarded part-time collaboration with the possibility of participanting for an extra prize, see our [2016 Competition](https://github.com/bitDubai/competition)
