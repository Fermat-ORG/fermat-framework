/**
 * A financial transaction is an agreement, communication, or movement carried out between a buyer and a seller to
 * exchange an asset for payment. It involves a change in the status of the finances of two or more businesses or
 * individuals. The buyer and seller are separate entities or objects, often involving the exchange of items of value,
 * such as information, goods, services, and money. It is still a transaction if the goods are exchanged at one time,
 * and the money at another. This is known as a two-part transaction: part one is giving the money, part two is
 * receiving the goods.
