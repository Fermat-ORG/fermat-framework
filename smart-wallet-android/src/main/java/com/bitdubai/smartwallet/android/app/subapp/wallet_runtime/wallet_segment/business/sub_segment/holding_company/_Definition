A holding company is a company or firm that owns other companies' outstanding stock. The term usually refers to a
company that does not produce goods or services itself; rather, its purpose is to own shares of other companies to form
a corporate group. Holding companies allow the reduction of risk for the owners and can allow the ownership and control
of a number of different companies.

In the United States, 80% or more of stock, in voting and value, must be owned before tax consolidation benefits such
as tax-free dividends can be claimed.[1] That is, if Company A owns 80% or more of the stock of Company B, Company A
will not pay taxes on dividends paid by Company B to its stockholders, as the payment of dividends from B to A is
essentially Company A switching cash from one of its pockets to another. Any other shareholders of Company B will pay
the usual taxes on dividends, as they are legitimate and ordinary dividends to these stockholders.
