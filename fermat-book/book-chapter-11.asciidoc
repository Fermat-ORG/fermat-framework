== Chapter 11: Fermat Digital Assets Management

=== What is a Digital Asset ?

A Digital Asset is a digital representation of a product or service that can be obtained in exchange of the asset. Another way of saying this, is that it is a representation of something of value that comes with a "right to use" for the assets possessor. ( The asset can be *redeemed* and the end user gets the product or service represented by it) + 
To create a digital asset two main components are needed:
 
the asset meta-data :: a set of information of what is represented by the asset and the conditions attached to it (*asset contract*)
the validation code :: a method that proofs that the asset is genuine and that it cannot be duplicated or forged+
Fermat incorporates the management of Digital Assets over crypto, being the crypto component what ensures it authenticity among other very useful features granted by using blockchain technology. +
The application of Digital Assets is as wide as the digital world. There are some assets types that are familiar and some that sound like sci-fi. +
