== Chapter 6: Fermat Network and Communication Superlayer
This superlayer provides connectivity between *devices* by stablishing a _communication channel_ between a plug-in running on a *local device* which requires to consume certain service from its _counterpart_ (i.e. the plug-in with the same task) running on a *remote device*. +
This superlayer takes the entire responsibility of maintaining the communication channel "alive" as long as it is required, providing this *service* as a whole, i.e. offering this channel to the external layers and plug-ins in a *transparent* way for them, regardless of the *communication technology* that the layer uses to build this channel *_dynamically_*. + 
The upper layers should not be aware of the technology in use (wi-fi, NFC, p2p, bluetooth, etc.) and problems related to a connection should be solved by the communication layer without disturbing the clients. +
This ensures a safe way to offer *network services* built on top of this layer, not only for Fermat developers but also to third party. +


[[communicationLayer]]
=== _Communication Layer_
This is the only layer in this superlayer which provides the communication services as a whole, i.e. components that need to be communicated interact with the *layer interface* and not directly to any plug-in inside. Each one of them implements the communication protocols and interfaces for one of the different *communication technologies* available.

Cloud Client :: 
This plug-in manages the requirement of a *client* plug-in to stablish a connection to a _counterpart_ plug-in running on another device. It transmit the call to the _cloud server_ which "switches on" the communication channel to the destination party.

Cloud Server :: 
For certain basic communications demand, a cloud server is a reasonable good option. At initialization of Fermat, the cloud server manager receives the initial "log in" signal of each service that is starting, and keeps record of their "online"status. Then, when a _local_ *network service* needs to contact its _counterpart_ , the cloud server has the necesary information to stablish the  *communication channel* requested.
