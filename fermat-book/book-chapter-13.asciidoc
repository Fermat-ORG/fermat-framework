== Chapter 13: Fermat Crypto Commodity Money
This platform introduces the first abstraction on crypto currency: as its value is exclusively determined by the market, it can be taken as any other available *commodities* to establish a correlation between the crypto value and the value of any set of Fiat Money that the end user is used to operate with. By means of this, the value is held in cryptocurrency but the transactions and the general wallet functions are displayed in Fiat Currency to make it easier for the end user to run his business in a way he is more familiar with. +

=== New components
Some of the new components added to the framework by this platform are :

* money requests and money transmission registered to show value in *fiat money*
* Crypto Commodity Money Wallet
* Discount Wallet

=== Crypto Commodity Money Wallet
This niche wallet performs the transaction in crypto currency but the results are displayed in *fiat currency*.

=== Discount Wallet
This niche wallet aims to protect the value stored in the user's by suggesting profitable conditions to spend it. It checks the _exchange rate_ at the time the end user consider ates spending the money and compares it with the rate when the crypto value was purchased, and shows the *positive difference* (gain) as a virtual *discount rate* to the end user at the time he consider ates spending it.
