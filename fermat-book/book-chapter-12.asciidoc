== Chapter 12: Fermat Crypto Currency Platform
This platform introduces the first *niche wallets* to manage existing crypto currencies - Bitcoin Wallet, Litecoin Wallet, Ripple Wallet, etc - and also the resources to develop wallets of new cryptocurrencies invented in the future. + 

The new identities introduced in this platform are:+
[horizontal]
Intra-Crypto-Wallet-User identity :: +
Extra-Crypto-Wallet-User identity :: +

For a *niche wallet* to run, we need _reference wallets_ and underlying plug-ins which grant: +

. user identification 
. device identification
. cryptonetwork services 
. cyptoaddress management (addressbook)
. network services 
. world services ( to access exchange rates, non-Fermat wallets, etc ...)
. transactions management 

=== New components
Some of the new components added to the framework by this platform are those to offer the following functionalities:

* crypto address management, crypto money requests and crypto money transmission
* consulting of crypto currency indexes 
* crypto money transactions
* Bitcoin Wallet
* Bitcoin Loss Protected Wallet

=== Bitcoin Wallet
Fermat's Bitcoin *Niche Wallet*  is a _basic wallet_ in terms of its functionalities, even simpler as other popular BTC wallets on the market. This is so  to maximize its ulterior reutilisation. + 
This wallet provides the minimum necessary functionalities to perform a succesful transaction of Bitcoins: +

* to make a payment in BTC ( send value to a BTC Wallet owner)
* to receive payments in BTC
* to show the transactions 
* to show the balance of the wallet
* to show a basic contacts list ( username and cryptoaddress related to each contact)

////
The wallet prompts the user to provide a *password* ( or *passphrase* ) on first run. Then it generates a pair of privat key/public Key for him, and derived from it, a valid _bitcoin address_ and the QR-Code image associated with it.
When the user decides to send a payment, he enteres the amount and chooses the destination among the addresses stored in the contact's list, the wallet software creates a transaction with the valid format of a bitcoin transaction, it signes the transaction with the wallet's user unique digital signature (derived from his privat/public key), and sends it to the bitcoin network to be propagated among the active nodes and when it is confirmed by others, it becomes part of the blockchain. When the transaction is confirmed by a mining node, it is written inside a transaction block of a new bitcoin blockchain's block. +
At this stage, the BTC amount was really "spent" i.e. transfered from the wallet's user to the destination user.  
The wallet will then show its up-dated balance, and also the succesful transaction in the wallet's transaction's log.
////

NOTE: the simplicity of this wallet is maximized, it does NOT handles payment or money request and and it is _wether_ interconnected with other wallets _not_ showing anything else but plain BTC currency. (no FIAT money abstraction!)

=== Bitcoin Loss Protected Wallet 
This is the second *Niche Wallet* developed by Fermat, and its main goal is to protect the user from losing money when attemping to spend 
Bitcoin at a change curse lower that the price when that Bitcoin amount was purchased (entered the wallet). +
The new functionalities added are:

* to store the *exchange rate* when a BTC amount is received in the wallet
* to check the *exchange rate* when the user attemps to spend an amount of BTC and to freeze the funds if they are below the *purchase price*
