== Appendix 03: Money and Crypto Currency 

=== What's behind money?
In our daily live we have accepted money as something present in almost every activity of human endeavor, and most of us use it without reflecting on its origin or its deeper meaning. Making it simple, money is an agreed mean of exchanging value. By its universal adoption it allows a flow of products and services between the different actors in a producer-consumer chain ( or better, in a "web" of commercial interactions) and following this, an exchange of the value associated with each step, rewarding each actor with a portion of the entire value, what we call "profit". 
During the early ages trading was made directly exchanging certain goods for other goods, then as trading was growing at scale, the necessity of unification of mass and measures lead to the rising of money representing in some way the value of what was being exchange and a relative consensus over it. Later on, with the rising of the different nations which created a certain unification under certain name, language and government and rules to be applied to a determined territory and its inhabitants, this nations extended their sovereignty also to the issue of a national currency and the printing of "official" paper money. At the beginning the amount of paper money was guaranteed by a national reserve on gold, but most of government abandoned the *gold standard* after the 1930 world crisis, and after 1971 the US government severed definitely the link between US Dollar to gold. This means, that the current money we use only depends on the "trust" we deposit on the government that rules its emission and this "legal curse" is enforced by law. There is NOT ANY OTHER intrinsic property on paper money to ensure its value than this!! When talking about corruption in some of our political and financial institutions, we can easily perceive how often this trust has been abused. This kind of money enforced by law which value is not linked to any specific asset has been called *fiat money*.

=== Cryptocurrency
When Bitcoin solved the issues that prevented other digital currencies to become a viable _digital money_ ( *authenticity* of the issuing and ownership and the *"double-spend"* problem) it opened a whole new world in financial systems and economy, where cryptography provides the basis for trusting the legitimacy of a user's claim to value. So, this new kind of currency that is entirely virtual and that is implied in transactions that transfer value from sender to recipient based on cryptographic signatures is what we call *cryptocurrency*.

NOTE: The undeniable achievement of Bitcoin's electronic signature protocol based on *cryptography* is the creation of a distributed public ledger of peer-to-peer electronic transactions that is transparent and at the same time preserves the anonymity and the security needed to become a safe way of transporting *value*, based on *consensus agreement*. This technology opens the door to a new paradigm in economics, computer science, financial operations, and world-wide commerce. +  
Nakamoto's invention makes possible to unveil the world of financial transactions, to get rid of the necessity of *trust* into a third party institution or central governments, to make money a secure thing, and transactions transparent and effortless. It returns to the money's owner the absolute control over his richness. +
This *trust-less* (or *trust-free*) cryptocurrency scheme encourages us to adopt a radical new point of view on money and the concept of value itself and its transport, so radical, that it will take us  time and effort to really grasp it, because it leads to the unconditionally honoring and empowering of each individual. 


TIP: Taking Bitcoin as "the" paradigmatic model of every cryptocurrency, we need to have in mind that for Bitcoin to exist following is needed: +
* A decentralized peer-to-peer network (the bitcoin protocol) + 
* A public transaction ledger (the blockchain) +
* A decentralized mathematical and deterministic currency issuance (distributed mining) +
* A decentralized transaction verification system (transaction script) +
