== Chapter 10: Fermat Money Management

Monetary transactions in Fermat are handled separating the *transport of value* (that follows an specific _workflow_) from the accountancy of the money, and this all is separated from the transmission of the aditional information of the transaction ( the meta data ). +
Usually transactions start in specialized plug-ins of one of the transaction layers, an the workflow's chain of actions reach to different levels, from consuming services of the lower layers such as the _Blockchain superlayer_ to connect with the *crypto networks*, to the high level GUI components. The process interacts with Fermat's _vaults_ in the _Crypto Currency Platform_ to record the value, and contacts the *wallet* component to do the accountancy. + 
The rest of the information of the transacting not related to the value, is transmitted throught the different _network services_ through the Fermat Network which allow this *meta data* reach the GUI components and be displayed to the end user in a comprehensive way. +
This starts in the originating device and then both flows - value and meta data - meet at the recipients device activating the counterpart plug-ins to record everything accordingly and validate the transaction.
