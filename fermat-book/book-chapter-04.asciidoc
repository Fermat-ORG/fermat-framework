[[superlayers]]
== Chapter 4: Fermat Superlayer Operating Systems 

NOTE: We call Fermat *Superlayer* to a group of layers whose components offer services to be consumed system-wide, i.e. offering an infrastructure that holds different *platforms* running over Fermat. (its like a "common ground" where different "towers" (the platforms) are built, sharing basic level services)

This superlayer allows the connectivity of OS dependent components to the rest of the Fermat multi-platform that is _OS independent_. The components offer the necessary functions to interact with the corresponding OS, like storing and retrieving information, managing files, managing user log-in, checking the device status, location, etc + 
Specific layers will be added as long as Fermat's releases include new OS. +
This low level layer allows to build on top of successive layers the components necessary to implement the *Desktop Applications* offered to Fermat end users.

=== _Android layer_
In this layer, we find the different components that allows Fermat to function on a device running Android. They are written in _android language_.
[horizontal]
File System :: Allows for the creation of files in a reserved memory area for each Plug-in (it functions as a "private folder")
Database System :: Allows for the creation of a database only readable for the Plug-in that owns it.  
Logger :: Access to the OS activity log.
Device Location :: Access to the GPS coordinates to determine device location.
Device Connectivity :: Access to peripherals connecting to the device through USB Port / Bluetooh Port / etc.. 
Device Power ::
Device Contacts ::
Device Hardware:: Information about the hardware of the device running the platform +

=== _Multi OS layer_
In this layer there are components that run in more than one OS at the time (Linux / MacOs / Windows). +
The components are similar to the other _OS layers_.
////
File System :: access to the file system
Database System :: access to plug-in proprietary databases +
////

=== _IOS_ layer
