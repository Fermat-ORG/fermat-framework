== Chapter 17: Fermat Crypto Broker Platform
In this platform the actors involved are the *crypto broker* and his customers (*crypto customers*). A *crypto broker* is a person or small organization whose business logic is to buy and sell cryptocurrency for fiat money in his local market, obtaining his profits from the difference in the buy/sell price. We distinguish also two usual levels of *crypto brokers*, those acting as *crypto brokers wholesalers* and those who deal with final customers. The key goal of this platform is to *facilitate* the most of the routine tasks to run the business and even provide the necesary functionalities to prevent _always_ the loss of money in every transaction.
