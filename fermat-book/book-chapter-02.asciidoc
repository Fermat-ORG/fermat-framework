== Chapter 2: Fermat as a Platform Stack Framework 
*Fermat* is, technically speaking, an Open Source P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Stack Framework Platform built on a Plug-ins architecture running on an end-user's device. 

[horizontal]
Open Source :: The code can be reviewed and audited by anyone.
P2P network and decentralized :: Censorship resistant and difficult to attack.
Platform Stack :: functionalities are wrapped in categories easy to grasp
Plug-in Architecture :: reuse of components and open so that any developer can participate.
It runs on end-users' devices :: users have control of their money without the need to trust a third party.

=== What is Fermat made up of?

* *Libraries*: Structural components from the system core (low level layers)  
* *Desktops*: Applications that run on a specific Operating System and present the GUI (graphic user interface)
* *Plug-ins*: Components that encapsulate a very specific set of functions, consume services from other components and offer a public interface for the services they provide to other components. They are open and can be developed by the developer community in general.
* *Add-ons*: plug-ins in the low level layers that provide the most sensitive functionalities to the system, and therefore are developed by trusted developers.

[[architecture]]
=== Fermat's architecture 

:numbered!:

Fermat system is built on several overlapping architectural paradigms: 

. At a higher level, it is a *Peer-to-Peer system with asymmetric nodes*, meaning that each node, even when having all of the codebase, specializes itself according to the profile of the end user or the way it was configured.

. Inside each node Fermat features a *multi-OS architecture* meaning that the lowest level OS-dependent components are wrapped in a way that can be easily replaced when running on a different OS without affecting the rest of the components that consume services from them. The up-most components, the ones facing the end user (GUI) are also OS-dependent. Everything in between is *not*.

. At the same time it features a plug-ins architecture inserted into a *multi-layered structure*. These layers are occasionally grouped into *Superlayers*. 

. These *Plug-ins* are subdivided into a hierarchy of *Platforms*. Those *Platforms* share a common set of layers, and each one adds *Actors* and *Products* to the overall functionality of the Fermat system. Inside each Plug-in, you might find a specialized structure and in many cases a database or files belonging to that Plug-in.

. At a system level, Fermat uses specialized crawlers to collect or sometimes inject information into nodes in order to recreate a system level consciousness prepared to resist attacks or other relevant issues.

==== P2P architecture
Fermat is a _distributed system_, that runs on end user's devices, so it needs to establish a connection between every actor and every device using it. This is done by creating a *P2P network* between them, based on the services provided by _Fermat P2P Network and Communication Superlayer_. +

==== Multi OS architecture
Fermat is *code-base portable*, meaning that the components are written in code that run in different operating systems. 
So, through _Fermat Operating Systems API Superlayer_, the components that are specific to a given Operating System, can connect to the rest of Fermat that is OS independent.

[[multilayer]]
==== Multilayer architecture
Fermat needs to be adaptable, to provide highly component reutilization, and to offer a scalability that match the complexity of the services that are running on it. Therefore the components are set in *layers* stacking one on top of the other. Each layer groups components that provide a similar functionality, i.e. a communication layer is designed to provide a way to connect one device to another building a "communications channel" using different available technologies (cloud servers, wifi, NFT, etc), and while performing this task, it lets other components from other layers do their specific task, consuming services of this communication layer in a transparent way (without any concern on how the communication is actually being established). +
There are certain *Layers* that provide services at a system-wide scale (see *superlayers*), but other layers are defined within one *platform* and serves to provide its set of specific functionalities.

==== Plug-ins architecture
*Plug-ins* have an outstanding feature: as long as their INTERFACE (i.e. the shape of the interconnection) is known and public, the Plug-in can interact with others, consuming and offering services, INDEPENDENTLY of its inner structure and how it is built. As long as they keep this INTERFACE, they can safely evolve to be more efficient and functioning WITHOUT altering a single service that has been built upon it! 
Inside Fermat, each Plug-in is given certain specific responsibility within; it lives in a certain layer, and it is allowed to consume services of components on _lower layers_ and to provide services to components of _upper layers_. Plug-ins participate in high level processes and are programmed in a way to live in an uncontrolled environment (end-user devices) and to co-exist with un-trusted third party plug-ins as well. 
With this, Fermat is able to connect and reuse most of the infrastructure deployed by the industry.

==== Platform architecture
A *platform* consists of a group of components living in different *layers* interconnected to offer a specific set of services for a discovered niche. i.e. if we address to crypto currency users, we will need a _crypto currency wallet_ for each crypto currency available running on _Fermat Crypto Currency Platform_. This wallet would operate on the selected crypto network by means of a connection provided to it by the _Blockchain Platform_, and it will interact with the user by means of a *desktop* living in the OS specific layers. 

=== Following the Master Plan
Once we have described Fermat's components and architecture, we will explore in the following chapters, the platforms that implement the foundations (Phase I) of the master plan:

- *Fermat Core Platform* 
- *Fermat Operating Systems Superlayer*
- *Fermat Blockchain Superlayer*
- *Fermat P2P Network and Communication Superlayer*
- *Fermat Plug-ins Platform*


For a cool view of Fermat and its constant growing number of platforms and superlayers visit http://fermat.org
We will cover the platforms and superlayers from bottom to top and from left to right, as they are presented in the visualization.

So, go ahead and enter the "building site" and explore the foundations.
