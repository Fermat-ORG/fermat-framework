Welcome to Fermat! 
-------------------

Fermat is an open-source P2P digital wallet platform that runs on multiple OS including Android, Linux, iOS, OSX and Windows.

What makes Fermat different from other wallet platforms or services?

* **Fermat is P2P.** That makes it censorship resistent and difficult to be attacked.

* **Fermat runs on end users' devices.** That enables users to hold their own money eliminating the need to trust a third party. 

* **Fermat segments the world population and brings a custom tailored solution for each segment.** Any developer can create niche wallets for a particular group of people. Brands can easily create their own wallet for their followers.

* **Fermat uses crypto currency networks as public value transport networks.** Fermat users cant choose to move their money arround the world easily and almost for free via these public value transport networks or the legacy financial system networks as well. 

Fermat is moving towards version 1, but we're not stopping there. We have many feature ideas on our
[documentation](https://github.com/bitDubai/fermat/fermat-documentation) that we're anxious to add. 
So take Fermat out for a spin and let us know how we can make it your favorite platform to launch your digital wallet. 

You can see some cool visualizations of the Fermat Platform and its P2P network at
