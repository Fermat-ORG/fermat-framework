/**
 * In finance, a loan is a debt provided by one entity (organization or individual) to another entity at an interest
 * rate, and evidenced by a note which specifies, among other things, the principal amount, interest rate, and date of
 * repayment. A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the
 * borrower.
 *
 * In a loan, the borrower initially receives or borrows an amount of money, called the principal, from the lender,
 * and is obligated to pay back or repay an equal amount of money to the lender at a later time.
 *
 * The loan is generally provided at a cost, referred to as interest on the debt, which provides an incentive for the
 * lender to engage in the loan. In a legal loan, each of these obligations and restrictions is enforced by contract,
 * which can also place the borrower under additional restrictions known as loan covenants. Although this article
 * focuses on monetary loans, in practice any material object might be lent.
 *
 * Acting as a provider of loans is one of the principal tasks for financial institutions. For other institutions,
 * issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a typical source of funding.
