# Dev Teams

## Introduction

Everything done on the Fermat project is done by a Team. We have several teams working in parallel. Most of them are teams of developers, but these are not the only team. We also have teams of graphic designers, 3d artists, video producers, copy writers, etc.

In these file you will have a list of Fermat's developers teams. Feel free to contact their team leaders in order to join them.

## Organization

The ideal size of a team is 5 people. Between all, they should cover all the fields needed for these kind of projects.

In Fermat teams are organized in a hierarchical way. This helps in reviewing changes in source code, since it is expected that a child team changes are pushed to its parent team in order to be reviewed, merged with their own changes and pushed again to the next parent. At the top of the hierarchy the core developers are the only merging the final batch of changes into the bitDubai codebase.
